# Template for tr-osforge images

A template for building custom bootc operating system images based on the lessons from [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) and [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io). It is designed to be used manually.  

This template uses the **multi-stage build architecture** from , combining resources from multiple OCI containers for modularity and maintainability. See the [Architecture](#architecture) section below for details.


## What's Included

### Build System
- Automated builds via GitHub Actions on every commit
- Awesome self hosted Renovate setup that keeps all your images and actions up to date.
- Automatic cleanup of old images (90+ days) to keep it tidy
- Pull request workflow - test changes before merging to main
  - PRs build and validate before merge
  - `main` branch builds `:testing` images
- Validates your files on pull requests so you never break a build:
  - Brewfile, Justfile, ShellCheck, Renovate config, and it'll even check to make sure the flatpak you add exists on FlatHub
- Production Grade Features
  - Container signing and SBOM Generation
  - See checklist below to enable these as they take some manual configuration

### Homebrew Integration
- Pre-configured Brewfiles for easy package installation and customization
- Includes curated collections: development tools, fonts, CLI utilities. Go nuts.
- Users install packages at runtime with `brew bundle`, aliased to premade `ujust commands`
- See [custom/brew/README.md](custom/brew/README.md) for details

### Flatpak Support
- Ship your favorite flatpaks
- Automatically installed on first boot after user setup
- See [custom/flatpaks/README.md](custom/flatpaks/README.md) for details

### ujust Commands
- User-friendly command shortcuts via `ujust`
- Pre-configured examples for app installation and system maintenance for you to customize
- See [custom/ujust/README.md](custom/ujust/README.md) for details

### Build Scripts
- Modular numbered scripts (10-, 20-, 30-) run in order
- Example scripts included for third-party repositories and desktop replacement
- Helper functions for safe COPR usage
- See [build/README.md](build/README.md) for details

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Repository

Click "Use this template" to create a new repository from this template.

### 2. Initialize the Project

Important: Change `finpilot` to your repository name in these 6 files:

1. `Containerfile` (line 4): `# Name: your-repo-name`
2. `Justfile` (line 1): `export image_name := env("IMAGE_NAME", "your-repo-name")`
3. `README.md` (line 1): `# your-repo-name`
4. `artifacthub-repo.yml` (line 5): `repositoryID: your-repo-name`
5. `custom/ujust/README.md` (~line 175): `localhost/your-repo-name:stable`
6. `.github/workflows/clean.yml` (line 23): `packages: your-repo-name`

Then open a shell in the project root and run

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
cd tr-osforge
git checkout main
```

### 3. Configure the GitHub Repository

- Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
- Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"

Your first build will start automatically! 

Note: Image signing is disabled by default. Your images will build successfully without any
signing keys. Once you're ready for production, see "Optional: Enable Image Signing" below.

- Enable pull requests for RenovateBot
  - Go to "Settings->Actions->General" scroll down to "Workflow permissions"
  - Select "Read and Write" permissions
  - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
- Set up status checks on "build and push image"
  - Branches->Add Classic Branch Protection Rule
  - Branch Name Pattern -> Main
  - Check "Require a pull request before merging"
    - Uncheck "Require approvals"
  - Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
    - In the text box, start typing "Build and push image", select when it autocompletes
  - Save the branch protection rule
- Set up PAT for Renovate so that its PRs will automerge
  - Go to personal settings
  - Then "Developer Settings->Personal Access Tokens"
  - Select "Fine-Grained Tokens", and "Generate New Token"
    - Token name should be ``$REPOSITORY_NAME-renovate``
    - Description should be "Token used by Renovate to automate dependency updates"
    - Set expiration date to whatever you are comfortable with
    - Repository access -> Only Select Repositories -- set to this repository
      - Grant access to Contents (Read/Write), Metadata (Read Only), and Pull Requests
        (Read/Write)
    - Copy the PAT
    - Go to "Settings->Secrets and variables->Actions" in the repository
    - Select "New Repository Secret"
    - Name: ``$RENOVATE_TOKEN``
    - Paste the PAT in the "Secret" text box
    - Open the file ``.github/workflows/renovate.yml`` in the repository
    - Replace ``${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`` with ``${{ secrets.RENOVATE_TOKEN }}``
    - Commit and push
- Enable automerge


### 4. Customize Your Image

Choose your base image in `Containerfile` (line 23):
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:stable
```

Add "features" for this image from ``tr-osforge`` in `build/build.sh`:
```bash
# Add the features from tr-osforge that you want to incude in your image.
# The scripts can be found in reusable_scripts/build; include the name without the ".sh"
# suffix, e.g. putting "google-chrome" in this array will run "google-chrome.sh" in your build.
# The scripts are run in order.
OSFORGE_SCRIPTS_TO_USE=(
    "flatpak-substiution-removals"
    "tr-pki"
    "tr-ui"
    ...
)
```
Add things unique to this image in ``build/image-overrides.sh``

Customize your apps:
- Add Brewfiles in `custom/brew/` ([guide](custom/brew/README.md))
- Add Flatpaks in `custom/flatpaks/` ([guide](custom/flatpaks/README.md))
- Add ujust commands in `custom/ujust/` ([guide](custom/ujust/README.md))

... but note what comes "for free" in the ``tr-osforge`` project under
``reusable_scripting/common``!

### 5. Development Workflow

All changes should be made via pull requests:

1. Open a pull request on GitHub with the change you want.
3. The PR will automatically trigger:
   - Build validation
   - Brewfile, Flatpak, Justfile, and shellcheck validation
   - Test image build
4. Once checks pass, merge the PR
5. Merging triggers publishes a `:testing` image

Merge from ``main`` to ``production`` to create a production image.

### 6. Deploy Your Image

Switch to your image:
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/your-username/your-repo-name:testing
sudo systemctl reboot
```

## Optional: Enable Image Signing

Image signing is disabled by default to let you start building immediately. However, signing is strongly recommended for production use.

### Why Sign Images?

- Verify image authenticity and integrity
- Prevent tampering and supply chain attacks
- Required for some enterprise/security-focused deployments
- Industry best practice for production images

### Setup Instructions

1. Generate signing keys:
```bash
cosign generate-key-pair
```

This creates two files:
- `cosign.key` (private key) - Keep this secret
- `cosign.pub` (public key) - Commit this to your repository

2. Add the private key to GitHub Secrets:
   - Copy the entire contents of `cosign.key`
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions ([GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository))
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `SIGNING_SECRET`
   - Value: Paste the entire contents of `cosign.key`
   - Click "Add secret"

3. Replace the contents of `cosign.pub` with your public key:
   - Open `cosign.pub` in your repository
   - Replace the placeholder with your actual public key
   - Commit and push the change

4. Enable signing in the workflow:
   - Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml`
   - Find the "OPTIONAL: Image Signing with Cosign" section.
   - Uncomment the steps to install Cosign and sign the image (remove the `#` from the beginning of each line in that section).
   - Commit and push the change

5. Your next build will produce signed images!

Important: Never commit `cosign.key` to the repository. It's already in `.gitignore`.

## Love Your Image? Let's Go to Production

Ready to take your custom OS to production? Enable these features for enhanced security, reliability, and performance:

### Production Checklist

- [ ] **Enable Image Signing** (Recommended)
  - Provides cryptographic verification of your images
  - Prevents tampering and ensures authenticity
  - See "Optional: Enable Image Signing" section above for setup instructions
  - Status: **Disabled by default** to allow immediate testing

- [ ] **Enable SBOM Attestation** (Recommended)
  - Generates Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security
  - Provides transparency about what's in your image
  - Requires image signing to be enabled first
  - To enable:
    1. First complete image signing setup above
    2. Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml`
    3. Find the "OPTIONAL: SBOM Attestation" section around line 232
    4. Uncomment the "Add SBOM Attestation" step
    5. Commit and push
  - Status: **Disabled by default** (requires signing first)

- [ ] **Enable Production Branch & Image Builds**
  - Do the thing:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b production
    git push origin
    ```
  - Follow pattern from Bluefin LTS:
    - ``testing`` tag on ``main`` branch
    - ``production`` tag on ``production`` branch
    - Push changes from ``main`` to ``production``

### After Enabling Production Features

Your workflow will:
- Sign all images with your key
- Generate and attach SBOMs
- Provide full supply chain transparency

Users can verify your images with:
```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/your-username/your-repo-name:stable
```

## Architecture

This template follows the **multi-stage build architecture** from @projectbluefin/distroless, as documented in the [Bluefin Contributing Guide](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/contributing/).

### Multi-Stage Build Pattern

**Stage 1: Context (ctx)** - Combines resources from multiple sources:
- Local build scripts (`/build`)
- Local custom files (`/custom`)
- **@projectbluefin/common** - Desktop configuration shared with Aurora
- **@projectbluefin/branding** - Branding assets
- **@ublue-os/artwork** - Artwork shared with Aurora and Bazzite
- **@ublue-os/brew** - Homebrew integration

**Stage 2: Base Image** - Default options:
- `ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main:latest` (Fedora-based, default)
- `quay.io/centos-bootc/centos-bootc:stream10` (CentOS-based alternative, no desktop)
- `quay.io/almalinuxorg/atomic-desktop-gnome:latest` (AlmaLinux based)

### Benefits of This Architecture

- **Modularity**: Compose your image from reusable OCI containers
- **Maintainability**: Update shared components independently
- **Reproducibility**: Renovate automatically updates OCI tags to SHA digests
- **Consistency**: Share components across Bluefin, Aurora, and custom images

### OCI Container Resources

The template imports files from these OCI containers at build time:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/base-main:latest /system_files /oci/base
COPY --from=ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest /system_files /oci/common
COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/brew:latest /system_files /oci/brew
```

Your build scripts can access these files at:
- `/ctx/oci/base/` - Base system configuration
- `/ctx/oci/common/` - Shared desktop configuration
- `/ctx/oci/branding/` - Branding assets
- `/ctx/oci/artwork/` - Artwork files
- `/ctx/oci/brew/` - Homebrew integration files

While not technically an OCI container, the resuable build scripts from ``tr-osforge`` can be found at:
- `/ctx/oci/tr-osforge`

**Note**: Renovate automatically updates `:latest` tags to SHA digests for reproducible builds.

## Local Testing

Test your changes before pushing:

```bash
just build              # Build container image
just build-qcow2        # Build VM disk image
just run-vm-qcow2       # Test in browser-based VM
```
or for the brave:

```bash
sudo just build
sudo bootc switch --transport containers-storage localhost/$IMAGE_NAME:localdev
```

## Security

This template provides security features for production use:
- Optional SBOM generation (Software Bill of Materials) for supply chain transparency
- Optional image signing with cosign for cryptographic verification
- Automated security updates via Renovate
- Build provenance tracking

These security features are disabled by default to allow immediate testing. When you're ready for production, see the "Love Your Image? Let's Go to Production" section above to enable them.
